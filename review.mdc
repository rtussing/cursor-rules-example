# Review Rule

When this rule is tagged with `@review`, it indicates that you should:

1. Pause current task progression
2. Review user comments about recent changes
3. Address each point that the user specifies
4. Make sure any edits improve code. Improved code is code that is more concise, maintainable, clear, efficient, and/or following best practices and existing patterns
5. When a user asks for an explanation only, you aren't required to make edits

Example usage:
```
@review
- I think the user table should have a different attribute for tracking status
```

```
@review The styling doesn't match our design system
```\

## Rules to follow when editing

- Do not edit comments just to add or remove a couple of words unless that edit is integral to the meaning or definition
  - For example, this is a useless edit because it doesn't change the meaning of anything: `### 4. API Endpoint Structure Options` --> `### 4. API Endpoint Structure`
  - For example, this is a useful edit because it changes the purpose of the comment from being an idea to being a plan: `#### Option A: User-Centric Invitations Endpoint (RECOMMENDED)` --> `#### User Invitations Endpoint`
