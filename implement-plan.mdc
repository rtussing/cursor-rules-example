# Implement Plan

When this rule is tagged, you are being provided with a pre-approved implementation plan (typically from the `.plans` directory) that has already been analyzed and reviewed.

Your task is to execute the plan faithfully: recognize and follow existing codebase patterns, maintain consistency with current architectural decisions, and avoid over-engineering solutions beyond what the plan specifies.

Keep your changes focused and minimal — only modify the files explicitly mentioned in the plan unless you encounter an unavoidable dependency.

If you identify a significant issue with the plan, need to deviate from it, or have any questions, pause and consult the user before proceeding.
